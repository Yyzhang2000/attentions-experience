Leave me alone for a minute .
I'll teach you a lesson .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
Madman , thou errest .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
The hurt can not be much .
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
Bring us some wine !
What a wonderful time to be alive !
Come you to make confession to this Father ?
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Why did this have to happen now ?
Accept it in body and spirit .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
She's not even fourteen years old .
Get you to bed , faith .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
May a plague strike both your houses .
Wife !
No !
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?
The date is out of such prolixity .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
Benvolio , who started this fight ?
Then he's no good .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .
What say you ?
The house will be so much quieter .
No , not till Thursday .
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
Find the people whose names are on this list ?
That's true .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
I prithee , and I'll pay thee bounteously , Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
Now , fellow , What is there ?
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Fare you well at once .
Romeo , come forth .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Are you this impatient ?
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
What do you think of his belief ?
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
Take him away .
I am for you .
I will acquit you .
What's your will ?
Sooth , but you must .
I'm not interested in being good .
Is this the madman ?
Where do you come from , sir ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
My soul , and not my child !
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?
Thank God and my horoscope !
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
But you began so rudely .
I'll come with you .
Yet I wish I could .
He must be possessed by the devil .
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
He's dead .
Have you no more to say ?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
Good .
How now ?
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Stay the friar too .
Romeo !
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
Romeo , come out .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
Soft , here follows prose .
I'll go to him .
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
Tell me , how did you get in here ?
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
O heavy day !
Stand , an you be a man .
I think you're denying what you really are .
They stumble that run fast .
I see that thou art poor .
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
I know not , madam .
Is it now afternoon ?
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .
Who's talking to him now ?
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
Unhappy fortune !
No , madam .
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
My head is pounding .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?
You do mistake me , sir .
Peter !
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
Well then , goodbye .
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
I beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?
Out .
This is a pitiful sight !
Give me the letter .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
Then I rebel against you , stars !
The competitors enter .
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
Out upon you !
I am not here .
Why are you knocking so hard ?
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
This is the place .
Curse the day !
M" , Malvolio .
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
Well , well , I don't care .
Here , take the ring .
Where is my mother ?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
But let them measure us by what they will .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
What are you , girl ?
Come , we burn daylight , ho !
It is not day .
It was .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
What's he that now is going out of door ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
Here's something good .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
Sin from thy lips ?
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .
Oh love !
Now heaven walks on earth .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
Let us therefore eat and drink .
Let me see her .
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
I know you're the right person for this job .
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .
Call her forth to me .
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , " Am I made ?
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
Give me my sin back .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .
In what chapter of his bosom ?
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
Do you like this haste ?
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
That rotten scoundrel !
How tragic !
Fool , I say !
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
You have amazed me .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
Scurvy knave !
The time is very short .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
There has never been so black a day as today .
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .
Commend me to thy lady .
What a pestilent knave is this same !
Run to the Capulets .
Tell me what it's about .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
Call , good Mercutio .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .
Hence , be gone , away !
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
What's your name ?
Bear hence this body and attend our will .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
Why the devil came you between us ?
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
That's excellent .
My duty hushes me .
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
I'll follow after you .
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
Thus with a kiss I die .
Do you not hear , fellows ?
No , I won't stay a second longer .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .
Please , sir , have patience .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
My soul and not my child !
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
Why , how now , Juliet ?
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
A grave ?
Isn't that what he said ?
I'll be a harsh master to them .
For the love o ' God , peace !
Let her hang me .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
Come , night .
What ?
Go with me to the vault .
Let's to bed , knight .
He says he'll come .
You've made up your mind , then ?
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
Teach me to forget to think !
Madam , I am here .
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .
Well then .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
Stop , Sir Toby !
Let's get out of here .
Get to the point now .
Can't I say something ?
Madam , I will .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
I know you .
Like medicine for a sick man .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
I could be sad .
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
No .
I can tell that you don't know who I am .
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
Oh , poor Romeo !
Stop crying .
Who are you ?
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
Hunting what , Curio ?
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Go tell him of this .
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
You'll know more about it later .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
You take your pennyworths now .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
O , you give me ill counsel .
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
Lead me on .
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .
I'll to him .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
No matter .
Go .
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
In the wars .
Fly hence and leave me .
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
Oh , say so , and so be !
Please let me prove you're a fool .
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
I will be free from thee .
Hey , mistress !
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
Go on , go on .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
Fear me not .
What's this noise ?
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .
From now until then seems like twenty years .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
I say , remember .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven restore thee !
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .
Get up .
Ay , ay .
No , sir , no jot .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
It doth not fit me .
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
What manner of man ?
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !
This is Illyria , lady .
Wilt thou be gone ?
A love song , a love song .
Put your sword away .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
Here comes the little villain herself .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
We can not be here and there too .
Come on , you're being ridiculous !
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .
Take me to the garden .
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
With crisscrossed laces ?
Do you love me ?
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
Who's she ?
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .
Please go inside .
Romeo is coming .
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .
Is it really true ?
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
By the hour of nine .
Hello , sir .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?
But what say you to Thursday ?
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .
Make it a word and a blow .
Goodbye .
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
His eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
Go tell him about this .
Cheers , boys .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?
Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
All this is comfort .
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
Good fool , for my brother's death .
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
Hie you to church .
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
No , sir .
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
And so adieu , good madam .
Beshrew his soul for me !
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
I drink to thee .
M" , Malvolio .
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
You're all lazy and shallow .
No .
Spare not for the cost .
Good .
These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Onward , lover boys !
Where is my page ?
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
Vent my folly !
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .
Whence came you , sir ?
No , leave him alone .
Yes , madam .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
What's this ?
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
The woman I love is beautiful .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
Pharmacist !
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
Tomorrow will I send .
A grave ?
Peace , ho , for shame !
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
Ay , madam .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
The knave counterfeits well .
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .
Here's a drink .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .
This makes me feel so much better !
O Romeo , Romeo !
Please , young man , don't make me angry .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .
Never trust me , then .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
It alone concerns your ear .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
You may leave .
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
I will not fail .
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
What kind of man is he ?
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
Well , you're not on target there .
Or are you just pretending ?
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
You say well .
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .
Madam , I am not well .
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
My sweet , so do I .
I'll not meddle with him .
You'll not endure him !
Are they likely to get dusty ?
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
Holy Franciscan Friar !
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
Art thou a man ?
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
Oh , ho !
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
What , are you mad ?
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
My servant !
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .
All men call thee fickle .
A little bit .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
Scurvy knave !
He'll tell you more of the story .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
There is no obstruction in this .
Peace , you mumbling fool !
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
But he's not better than mine .
I want my sword .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
There's money for thee .
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
I know my medicine will work on him .
His counsel now might do me golden service .
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
I'll bite my thumb at them .
A right good markman !
It must be something I did accidentally .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
You're a smart guy .
You pale face !
Don't refuse it .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
I will carry no crotchets .
You had this child with the help of heaven .
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
Capulet , you villain !
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
Keep your money .
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
So let her execute me .
Why , may one ask ?
Call in my gentlewoman .
How are you , my friend ?
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
Who is 't that calls ?
Yes , but who is he ?
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
What hast thou found ?
We have a little dessert coming up .
The door's right here .
This is well .
Stand up .
What kind of woman is she ?
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
A good lenten answer .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
To supper ?
Come break this up , Benvolio .
The man's going crazy .
Let me speak a little .
A conduit , girl ?
Give me comfort .
Why do you say that ?
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .
Tis no time to play now .
Take away this body , and do what I say .
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
Art thou mad ?
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .
I don't think so , my lord .
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
I told him you were sick .
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
Marry , 'tis enough .
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
Do your job .
By'r Lady , thirty years .
Nurse ?
So I die with a kiss .
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .
How canst thou try them so ?
Marry , I remember it well .
What , Curio ?
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
Jove , I thank thee !
Pitiful sight !
Saint Francis , help me !
A love song , a love song .
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .
Come on , Sir Andrew .
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
You haven't been conquered .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
How is't with you , sir ?
Yes , that's the idea .
No man must know." What follows ?
Blab my nonsense !
I wot well where he is .
What is the matter with thee ?
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
Why , man ?
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .
By my heel , I care not .
Sir , no .
May not one speak ?
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
Oh , I have read it .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
Oh life !
I do .
Madam !
Not to his father's .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
Come , Romeo .
How vexest thou this man !
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
I have to obey .
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
Nay , I'll conjure too !
So listen up , princess .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
I'll go to lunch .
Sport royal , I warrant you .
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?
Ha ?
You take your beauty sleep now .
Fare you well .
Oh , thou art deceived .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
Oh , she's slow !
How old is she ?
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .
Hie you to the cell .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .
What , ho ?
He was not born to shame .
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
Is that really what you meant ?
I am not for this ambling .
Go ahead .
Go .
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
Are you an actor ?
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
Put up your sword .
Amen , amen .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
Don't swear at all .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .
Let all the rest give place .
If you be not mad , be gone .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Farewell .
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
My back a ' t ' other side .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
I'll do it .
Were you here when it started ?
Away !
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .
Think upon these gone .
So get out of here !
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .
Her lord is come .
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
Monday , my lord .
Give me your hand .
As plain as I see you now .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?
Good afternoon , fair lady .
That's a lame answer .
He sees thee not .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow Prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
Oh painful sympathy !
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
Hie to high fortune !
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
Give us the place alone .
Adieu , adieu !
Fight to the death" is his motto .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?
The slip , sir , the slip .
I could not find him at the Elephant .
Strike !
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .
How long has he been there ?
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
Wait good Nurse .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
I wish this trick would be over .
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
Before and apace .
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
No better .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
But if she can't love you , sir ?
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
I'll give it back to you .
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
It is a most sharp sauce .
Thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
We'll to dinner , thither .
Absolutely , you idiot .
How is it with her ?
Hark you , sir .
I won't move to please anybody .
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .
You , sir ?
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
You shall hear more .
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
I like it not .
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
You're right , sir .
Where is my Romeo ?
I'm suddenly afraid .
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .
Shame on you !
Well , you have made a foolish choice .
Will it not be ?
Oh , I'll rest here forever .
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
He speaks not true .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
Where should she be ?
Here comes the Countess .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
Hold the friar too .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has .
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
What's the matter ?
What do you want ?
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
You are too hot .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .
What kind of woman is't ?
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again .
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
You're not paying attention to me .
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
You are idle , shallow things .
I can't love him .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Saint Francis be my speed !
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
No matter .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !
What's going on ?
Pox on 't !
Oh , it is my love .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .
My lady is within , sir .
That last is true .
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Don't say anything else .
Let's go .
Orsino .
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
Watch his reaction .
Yet you began rudely .
What with a torch !
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .
Good night .
Arms , make your last embrace !
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
Why , would that have mended my hair ?
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
Oh , blessed , blessed night !
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?
I am none of his skains-mates .
Are you still so cruel ?
I'll go alone .
Give me the vial .
Don't think about her .
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !
So , let me hear you speak .
Ass , I doubt not .
No , not at all .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
I shall answer for her .
Oh , there's my lady !
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .
What is yond gentleman ?
Here comes your father .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .
Orsino .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
You mean I should groan and tell you ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
How does he love me ?
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
But I am thankful that you have found it .
He's somewhere else in the house .
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
Are you all crazy ?
Do 't , knight .
Sing us a song .
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
I could not stay behind you .
Oh my , Oh my !
Go ask .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
Romeo .
It's been longer , it's been longer .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
It's possible , ma'am .
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .
I had a dream last night .
But as well ?
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
Come to my room later on .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
Oh , it is my love .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
To answer that , I should confess to you .
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
Please , keep it to yourself .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
Give me faith , say I .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
Now I must go to the tomb alone .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
I'll not to bed tonight .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Then weep no more .
The other did not so .
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
Thou'rt a scholar .
Art thou a churchman ?
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
No man must know." What comes after that ?
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
Don't deny to him that you love me .
This man is probably like that .
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .
I speak no treason .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .
And what to ?
I'm everywhere .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
Take away the lady .
Will it be ever thus ?
My fan , Peter .
But what's your jest ?
Only you would look for a fight like that .
Yes , well , things could get better .
Where is she ?
Are you biting your thumb at us ?
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
Then have at thee , boy !
Eyes , look your last .
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
What , not a word ?
I asked a servant .
I will follow you .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
She will A pimp !
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .
One kiss , and I'll descend .
Oh friendly friar !
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Why , I am glad on 't .
Give me your torch , boy .
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
Ay me , detested !
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
Good man , why are you crying ?
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
Alright , here's the vial .
Goodbye , dear Father .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
You must have figured out who I am .
He named Sebastian .
Didn't he come home last night ?
Speak not .
